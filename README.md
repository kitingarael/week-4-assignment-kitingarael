# Week-4-Assignment

## Question:

Suppose you're tasked with designing an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for a basic library system. The system needs to track information about books, authors, library members, and borrowing history. Design an ERD to represent these relationships.

## Requirements:

## Entities:
Book: Each book has a unique ID, title, and publication year.
Author: Each author has a unique ID and name.
Library Member: Each member has a unique ID and name.
Borrowing: Each borrowing has a unique ID, a due date, and a return date.
## Relationships:
Each book can have one or more authors, and each author can write one or more books.
Each borrowing is associated with one book and one library member. A book can be borrowed by multiple members, and a member can borrow multiple books.
## Tasks:

## Design an ERD:
Create an ERD illustrating the relationships between books, authors, library members, and borrowings.
Use simple symbols to represent entities, attributes, and relationships.
